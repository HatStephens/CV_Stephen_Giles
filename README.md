##About
In September 2014 I embarked on a 12 Week Coding Bootcamp with [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com), which represented a big change in career path and lifestyle. Apart from two C++ Modules completed ten years earlier as part of my Mathematics Degree this was a new challenge and one in which I would learn a lot.
I thoroughly enjoyed the course and the intellectual stimulation that coding provided. With a background in Mathematics, my ability to problem solve and think logically helped me to tackle some aspects of these newly acquired skills. The course was primarily based around Ruby and JavaScript, and I felt that my strengths were coding the 'back-end logic' as well as debugging when errors occurred. That said, the 'front-end' was also something that I found enjoyable and interesting, in particularly working with jQuery.
The sections below should provide more information about what I have achieved prior to this change, but also provide an insight to some of the work and projects I have completed in the last 12 weeks. I am very aware that I have experienced only the tip of a very big iceburg that is 'coding' and am now seeking employment which will allow me to continue to learn and development my skills - whether that be in Web Development, App Development or Software Development.

##Education
#### [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) (September 2014 - December 2014)
A 12 Week Immersive Coding Bootcamp. Here I spent 12 weeks learning how to code primarily based around the Ruby and JavaScript languages. I used HTML, CSS and jQuery on the front-end to build Web Applications initially using Sinatra and then Rails. As well as this, I also spent a week learning Swift and Xcode to produce a native iOS App. PostgresSQL was the database used for the majority of projects (with Active Record and DataMapper).
Makers Academy are very effective at teaching TDD and I used RSpec, Cabybara and Jasmine for testing. We used Git for version control and various APIs including Twilio, GitHub, FaceBook and GoogleMaps.
I also had some experience with Node.js, Express, Socket.io and Sass.
